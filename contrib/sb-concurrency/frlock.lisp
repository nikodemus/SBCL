;;;; FRLocks for SBCL
;;;;
;;;; frlock is a "fast read lock", which allows readers to gain unlocked access
;;;; to values, and provides post-read verification. Readers which intersected
;;;; with writers need to retry. frlock is very efficient when there are many
;;;; readers and writes are both fast and relatively scarce. It is, however,
;;;; unsuitable when readers and writers need exclusion, such as with SBCL's
;;;; current hash-table implementation.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the

  "FRlock, aka Fast Read Lock.

Fast Read Locks allow multiple readers one potential writer to operate in
parallel while providing for consistency for readers and mutual exclusion
for writers.

Readers gain entry to protected regions without waiting, but need to retry if
a writer operated inside the region while they were reading. This makes frlocks
very efficient when readers are much more common than writers.

FRlocks are NOT suitable when it is not safe at all for readers and writers to
operate on the same data in parallel: they provide consistency, not exclusion
between readers and writers. Hence using an frlock to eg. protect an SBCL
hash-table is unsafe. If multiple readers operating in parallel with a writer
would be safe but inconsistent without a lock, frlocks are suitable.

The recommended interface to use is FRLOCK-READ and FRLOCK-WRITE, but those
needing it can also use a lower-level interface.

Example:

  ;; Values returned by FOO are always consistent so that
  ;; the third value is the sum of the two first ones.
  (let ((a 0)
        (b 0)
        (c 0)
        (lk (make-frlock)))
    (defun foo ()
       (frlock-read (lk) a b c))
    (defun bar (x y)
       (frlock-write (lk)
         (setf a x
               b y
               c (+ x y)))))

  ;; an epoch marker to keep track of that.
