;;;; This file implements the constraint propagation phase of the
;;;; compiler, which uses global flow analysis to obtain dynamic type
;;;; information.

;;; TODO:

;;; -- MV-BIND, :ASSIGNMENT
;;;
;;; Note: The functions in this file that accept constraint sets are
;;; actually receiving the constraint sets associated with nodes,
;;; blocks, and lambda-vars.  It might be make CP easier to understand
;;; and work on if these functions traded in nodes, blocks, and
;;; lambda-vars directly.

;;; Problems:
;;;
;;; -- Constraint propagation badly interacts with bottom-up type
;;; inference. Consider
;;;
;;; (defun foo (n &aux (i 42))
;;;   (declare (optimize speed))
;;;   (declare (fixnum n)
;;;            #+nil (type (integer 0) i))
;;;   (tagbody
;;;      (setq i 0)
;;;    :loop
;;;      (when (>= i n) (go :exit))
;;;      (setq i (1+ i))
;;;      (go :loop)
;;;    :exit))
;;;
;;; In this case CP cannot even infer that I is of class INTEGER.
;;;
;;; -- In the above example if we place the check after SETQ, CP will
;;; fail to infer (< I FIXNUM): it does not understand that this
;;; constraint follows from (TYPEP I (INTEGER 0 0)).

;;; Historically, CMUCL and SBCL have used a sparse set implementation
;;; for which most operations are O(n) (see sset.lisp), but at the
;;; cost of at least a full word of pointer for each constraint set
;;; element.  Using bit-vectors instead of pointer structures saves a
;;; lot of space and thus GC time (particularly on 64-bit machines),
;;; and saves time on copy, union, intersection, and difference
;;; operations; but makes iteration slower.  Circa September 2008,
;;; switching to bit-vectors gave a modest (5-10%) improvement in real
;;; compile time for most Lisp systems, and as much as 20-30% for some
;;; particularly CP-dependent systems.

;;; It's bad to leave commented code in files, but if some clever
;;; person comes along and makes SSETs better than bit-vectors as sets
;;; for constraint propagation, or if bit-vectors on some XC host
;;; really lose compared to SSETs, here's the conset API as a wrapper
;;; around SSETs:
