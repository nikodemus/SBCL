  "Produce a compiled function from DEFINITION. If DEFINITION is a
lambda-expression, it is coerced to a function. If DEFINITION is an
interpreted function, it is compiled. If DEFINITION is already a compiled
function, it is used as-is. (Future versions of SBCL might try to
recompile the existing definition, but this is not currently supported.)

If NAME is NIL, the compiled function is returned as the primary value.
Otherwise the resulting compiled function replaces existing function
definition of NAME, and NAME is returned as primary value; if NAME is a symbol
tha names a macro, its macro function is replaced and NAME is returned as
primary value.

Also returns secondary value which is true if any conditions of type WARNING
occur during the compilation, and NIL otherwise.

Tertiary value is true if any conditions of type ERROR, or WARNING that are
not STYLE-WARNINGs occur during compilation, and NIL otherwise.
